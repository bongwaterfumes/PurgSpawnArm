# Purgatorio Enemies
Adds enemies and bosses from Project Purgatorio to the Spawner Arm.

# It is highly recommended to play "RUBICON", "ENVY", and "INDULGENCE" on [Angry Level Loader](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/EternalsTeam/AngryLevelLoader/) before installing this mod to experience the enemies in the intended way.
